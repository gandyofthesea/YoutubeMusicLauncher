# YoutubeMusicLauncher (Windows)
A simple launcher for Youtube Music, something to add to the taskbar to get you right into the music.

## Why?
Moving away from spotify to Youtube Music i found myself looking for something to click on my taskbar that will open my music.
This is a simple go program that uses your chromium browser of choise to open directly into Youtube music.

## How? 
Run the install batch file, and it will arrange the required files and create a desktop shortcut, all you have to do is pin it to the taskbar, and complete the first time setup by clicking, and adding the path to your browser.


## Required
Golang needs to be installed 
run "go build" before running the install.bat
